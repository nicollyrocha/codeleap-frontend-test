# React + TypeScript + Vite

This is a project where the user enters a username on the signup page and, from there, can create posts and edit or delete their own, or like posts. The username is saved in localStorage, which is used to publish posts and which the user can edit or delete. Likes are not saved in the database, so they disappear when the page is refreshed.

Commands

```
yarn
```
```
yarn dev
```
